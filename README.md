## What's different in this stack from Blues?

- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) settings, especially with using Tailwind CSS
- [GoodUI](https://github.com/goodeats/goodui) component library created by me

Not a fan of bits of the stack? Fork it, change it, and use `npx create-remix --template your/repo`! Make it your own.

## Quickstart

In the interest of keeping changes from my forked repo as clear as possible, please refer to the documentation from the [Remix Blues Stack](https://github.com/remix-run/blues-stack). I will be sure to document any differences in this README where I can.
